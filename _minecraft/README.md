Here are the dummy classes of the Minecraft game.

The common code need to use Minecraft classes sometimes, but it cannot be depended on some Minecraft version. So it was 
decided to create a small module that would contain the necessary dummy classes from the game. 
This code is required to compile the common module, and will be excluded from the final artifact.
